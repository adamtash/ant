Light Check complete (Mon Feb 2, 2026 18:51:38 UTC).

What I checked
- Read `/Users/a/.ant/ant.log` tail and `.ant` state dir.

Findings
- Runtime is active (`/Users/a/.ant/ant.pid` present) and WhatsApp pings are flowing.
- The Light Check job started, selected `copilot` CLI provider, then the CLI call failed with exit code 1 and opened the circuit breaker.
- Fallback to `codex-cli` started; no completion logged yet in the last 50 lines.
- Log also shows “Session not found and could not be recovered” during the provider fallback.

Suggested next steps
1. Check the latest log lines to confirm whether the `codex-cli` fallback completed and the job finished.
2. Investigate the `copilot` CLI failure (exit 1) since it’s now tripping the circuit breaker.
